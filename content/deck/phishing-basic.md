## Smishing example

![wells faergo smishing](http://i.imgur.com/klY7QPK.jpg)

Note:

This one is very clever as it tricks the user into thinking they know their credit card number. Let me show you something. Who here has a credit card from a SEB bank account? I bet your card starts with 455262.

Nordea? If it's a debit card it's probably 4539, 4910 or 4918

Those numbers are what we call BIN, or Bank Identification Number, they are not tied to you, they are tied to your bank.

## Social Network phishing

As always, preying on human weaknesses:

- Curiosity
- Fear of being banned from the platform
- Sex

___
<!-- .slide: data-background="http://i.imgur.com/ZJru7gj.jpg" data-state="dim"-->

### Paranoïa is the cure

Never blindly trust what is displayed

- CallerID
- URL
 - Except in the browser bar
 - Or when you hover over links
- Email sender
 - For the nerds: Look in the headers

___
<!-- .slide: data-background="http://i.imgur.com/ZJru7gj.jpg" data-state="dim"-->

## Links on smartphones

- Long press on links to show the real destination

___
<!-- .slide: data-background="http://i.imgur.com/ZJru7gj.jpg" data-state="dim"-->

## URL bar on smartphones

- Smartphone browsers tend to hide address bar
 - Saving some screen space, but at a cost
 - Just scroll up a page and it will come back

Note:
Also please remember to check the URL in the browser bar, smartphone browser tend to hide it once you scroll down to save up space!

___
<!-- .slide: data-background="http://i.imgur.com/ZJru7gj.jpg" data-state="dim"-->
